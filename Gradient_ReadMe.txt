Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to find a minimum /maximum of a given function This method is commonly used in Machine Learning to minimise the cost function .which helps us get the slope and intercept which is ideal for the model.


In Practice I have implemented the code to see the reduction in cost function for each iteration by using a function to return all the values in a single dataframe.
