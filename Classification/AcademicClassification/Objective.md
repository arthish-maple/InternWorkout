Academic Success Project 

The project aims to identify students that are likely to dropout or graduate from the academy. Each student has a score associated with the probability of dropping out.The ML strategy applied to approach this problem is multiclass classification,using different ML algorithms to derive best model for the prediction.

In brief, the main idea behind this project is to build a model with academic data from students and assign a score of the likelihood of dropping out.
