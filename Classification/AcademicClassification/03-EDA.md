        <h3>Numerical variable Distribution</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>KDE Plot : is used for visualizing the Probability Density of a continuous variable. It depicts the probability density at different values in a continuous variable</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Categorical variable Distribution</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>countplot() :method is used to display the count of categorical observations in each bin in the dataset. </li>
          <li>boxplot(): is a graph summarising a set of data. The shape of the boxplot shows how the data is distributed and it also shows any outliers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Correlation</h3>
        <ul>
                  <li>Heatmaps are used to show relationships between two variables, one plotted on each axis. By observing how cell colors change across each axis, you can observe if there are any patterns in value for one or both variables</li>
